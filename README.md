SPEC-O-MATIC
============

Spec-o-matic is a quick Javascript project to learn how to OO in the language and to test an user experience.

Some backend is needed for the autocomplete feature. In my case, I create a django app that strips the steps from a git repo keeping the list of spec steps always up to date.
